## Running the Simulation
To run the simulation and generate synthetic performance data, normalize scores, and calculate confidence scores:

```bash
python uncsc.py
``` 

## Generating Visualizations
To generate visualizations of the node performance and rankings:

```bash
python uncsc_visgen.py
```
